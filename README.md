# TOL Project 2 - Peer Learning Tool

- This code was adapted to make a peer tutoring tool. It has an interface to move both a tutor and tutee through a peer learning session
- The greeting 'hi' or 'hello' will activate the agent. Each student has to self-assign their roles.
- The script is different for tutors and tutees.  There are different activation words to avoid incorrect prompting. 
- A hint button was included with adaptive hints for both roles. 
- The tutor hint button has 2 layers: the first layer suggests sentence frames to support the tutee, the second layer gives conceptual hints to talk about and where to point for more information.
- The tutee hint button only suggests sentence frames.
